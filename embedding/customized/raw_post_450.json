In the screenshot below, the getaddrinfo function is used by the server to set up a socket based on the parameters specified (i.e ai_family, ai_socktype, and ai_flags). However, on the client side, they populate these parameters so that they match the parameters of the server that they're <strong>sending </strong>to.So does that then mean that the following needs to be the same on the client <strong>and </strong>server side:<ul><li>ai_family --&gt; this is IPv4 or IPv6</li><li>ai_soctype --&gt; it's clear that this will be SOCK_DGRAM from both the client and the server so no questions here</li><li>ai_protocol --&gt; beej uses a default of 0 for the server and client here</li></ul>Other Questions:<ul><li>What do we do if, for example, serverM is using IPv4 on Port #23000 (just an example) and serverC is using IPv6? Do I have to use port #23000<em>\u00a0</em>to send UDP messages to serverC? Or can I open a separate socket for M so that it becomes a \"client\" and then the program can <em>intentionally</em> pick a socket that is compatible with serverC.</li><li>OR, should I just make sure that all servers are set up exactly the same and are therefore are all running under the same IP family (beej uses IPv6 so that is what I would default to)? If I set them all up in the same way, then I won't have to make sure the sockets are compatible every time I send a message between the servers - that is my understanding?</li></ul>Basically what I'm trying to ask is how do you ensure communication is compatible between two <em>servers </em>in UDP? It's not an issue with client/servers because the client will always pick a socket that as parameters that matches the server or return an error. But with servers, once you turn them on (i.e set up the socket), they shouldn't suddenly change their parameters.
