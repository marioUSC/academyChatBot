Instead, HW1 wants you to randomly pick a single sample or a batch of samples to compute gradients on it, then call it an iteration. I have updated the discussion slides for your reference. Let’s stick to HW1’s definition of SGD and Mini-Batch GD when you program and analyze the performance of those algorithms.

If you define model residual as y - prediction, then gradient will be -2/n * x^t * residual. Those two gradient equations are identical but be careful with the sign when you code it.For SGD, you are supposed to run it directly. I can see the error is related to multiplying strings, but I am not sure what causes this error. Please check the functions you implement inside SGD.You can follow the plot function from other subsections to test your code. As long as you see a faster converging loss curve, you should be fine.",

As a result, many units remain idle, leading to inefficiencies.Data Movement Overhead: With fewer feature maps, there might be more frequent switching between layers or operations in the CNN. This can lead to more frequent data movement between the TPU's memory and its processing units, exacerbating RAW dependencies. Waiting for data to be written (from a previous operation) before it can be read (for the next operation) can introduce stalls.Hope that helps.Arash",

To make the most of this capability, data must be marshaled or transferred in large chunks to the TPU. Loading data in bulk minimizes the overhead of frequent memory accesses and optimizes the bandwidth utilization.The ability to pipeline reads from memory is a critical feature for TPUs. This ensures that while one chunk of data is being processed, the next chunk can be read from memory, and thus the TPU is kept busy.For the TPU (or Eyeriss) to read data efficiently, the data needs to be appropriately aligned. Misaligned data can lead to inefficient memory access patterns, reducing the performance benefits of the specialized hardware.",

I mentioned that there exists techniques such as differential privacy, multi party computing and secure enclaves to protect against privacy leaks. I will cover multi party computing in class tomorrow and I *hope*  to cover enclaves in class after differential privacy (as time permits). But to understand secure enclaves a deeper understanding of virtual memory is a must. I hope you all are familiar with virtual memory in your prior course work. If not, you are welcome to attend the virtual memory lecture I plan to start today in my EE557 class at 4PM in OHE 132. It is just a coincidence that the timing worked out. You are welcome to attend 557 lecture so as to familiarize yourself with virtual memory. That way when I discuss secure enclaves it is a bit easier to comprehend that enclave notion later.Murali",

In terms of loss computation, please refer to the HF libraryhere.You can instantiate a llama model with only one decoder layer (without loading weights) to test your code when implementing.

Here are some explanations about your grades:We used the tables below (also published in the syllabus) for your grade calculation, however, we incorporated a very generous method for giving everyone up to 18% total extra credit as follows:5% for each reading assignment (total of 10%).8% for HW6.This means we first calculated your final grade using Table 1, (excluding reading assignments 1, 2 and HW6), then we added up to 18% based on your grades on the reading assignments 1, 2 and HW6.The extra credit on the final exam was applied to your final exam grade itself.Your final letter grade is calculated based on Table2.Please note that due to the rather generous extra credit points, there will be no curving or any other special considerations.If you have any questions or concerns about your grade, please contact us ASAP (by the end of today).Thanks and best of luck,Arash and Murali",
