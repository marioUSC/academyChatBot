    "58": "questions : hw4 p15 non-unique forwarding tables since r1 can reach e through either of the bottom 2 interfaces , does it matter which one we assign in the forwarding table ? my understanding is that these tables can be generated differently depending on criteria , so it seems like there could be multiple possible forwarding tables right ? answer : theoretically , you are right but the author is assuming that no packet is actually destined to any of the routers interfaces which means the following : if r1 receives a packet ( we do n't care from where ) then the destination ip address must be a host on subnets a or b or c , i.e . the packet ca n't be destined to say r2 interfaces or r3 interfaces . the forwarding table at r1 should have 3 entries as follows : if destination host is in subnet a , then the outgoing interface should be the one connected to subnet aif the destination is in subnet b then the outgoing interface should be the one connected to subnet dif the destination is a host in subnet c , then the outgoing interface should be the one connected to subnet fand similarly for r2 and r3.the author is assuming all point-to-point links are of the same length and hence he is using the shortest distance criteria ( or minimum number of hops ) the author is sloppy for neglecting these assumptions in his question . of course the forwarding tables will depend on the criteria used to choose a route.stay safe and healthy dear",

    "397": "questions : why dhcp offer and ack frames are broadcasted ? the client sends its mac address to the server in the dhcp discover frame . could n't the server just use the client 's mac address as the destination for the dhcp offer and ack frames ? answer : the student 's response is right . updated response : from dhcp rfc ( rfc2131 ) : reason for broadcast for dhcpack and dhcpoffer : if 'giaddr ' is zero and 'ciaddr ' is zero , and the broadcast bit is set , then the server broadcasts dhcpoffer and dhcpack messages to 0xffffffff.if the broadcast bit is not set and 'giaddr ' is zero and 'ciaddr ' is zero , then the server unicasts dhcpoffer and dhcpack messages to the client 's hardware address and 'yiaddr ' address . ( page 22 ) unfortunately , some client implementations are unable to receive such unicast ip datagrams until the implementation has been configured with a valid ip address ( leading to a deadlock in which the client 's ip address can not be delivered until the client has been configured with an ip address ) . ( page 24 ) here : giaddr : relay agent ip address , used in booting via a relay agent.ciaddr : client ip address ; only filled in if client is in bound , renew or rebinding state and can respond to arp requestsyiaddr : 'your ' ( client ) ip address.reason for broadcast for dhcprequest : the client broadcasts a dhcprequest message that must include the 'server identifier ' option to indicate which server it has selected , and that may include other options specifying desired configuration values ... the servers receive the dhcprequest broadcast from the client . those servers not selected by the dhcprequest message use the message as notification that the client has declined that server 's offer . ( page 15 ) so from dhcprequest other servers get to know if the client has selected their ip address according to what professor explained , the reason of ack is being broadcasted is not because it has to tell other dhcp servers that a specific ip address is already assigned to the client . ( instead , this is the reason why request is broadcasted ) .the reason why ack is being broadcasted is because some network operating systems do not allow the client to be identified by the offered address until the client gets the acknowledgement.please let me know if i misunderstand something . thanks .",
