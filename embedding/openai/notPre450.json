    "1": "Final questions Dear everyone,I can’t wait for the final to come out. I really would like to know the answer right now! The questions regarding the integrity, authentication, and Confidentiality.1. A sender sends a message encrypted with the public key of recipient. Which is not provided?In my opinion, confidentiality is provided. Therefore, authentication and integrity are not provided. But we are only allowed to select one answer. Therefore, I am confused.2. A sender sends a message encrypted by his own private key. Which is not provided?In my opinion, authentication is provided. Therefore, confidentiality and integrity are not provided. But still, we are only allowed to choose one.Thanks. You are missing the most important word in question which is \"<strong>NOT</strong>\". Can you explain why do you say \"Data Integrity is NOT provided\"??? How could Trudy alter the message if the message is encrypted!!Only authentication (any one could use the recipient public key) is <strong>NOT</strong> provided.You are making the same mistake in the second question as well. If you encrypt your message with your private key, anyone can decrypt it using your public key and hence<strong> confidentiality is NOT provided</strong>. <strong>Both</strong> authentication (once you can decrypt the message using the public key of sender, that means the sender is who he claims to be) and data integrity (Trudy can not alter the message as it is encrypted)  <strong>are provided</strong>.",

These X-credit have NOTHING to do with EE450. This semester, USC beat UCLA, Stanford and University of  Notre dame (In Indiana). For each win , my kids get 1 point added to their midterm score.

There was an issue in D2L because of the extra credit scores due to which the scores were not displayed correctly. The comment mentioned should give some idea on which file/code is not running. The first thing you should do is to download the test cases used by TAs(uploaded to D2L) and try testing your code by yourself.

I am repeating it hereIf A is sending a frame to B and C is sending a frame to D, the frame from A will be collided with (collision happens at node B) but the frame from C to D will not be affected.

In the lecture, we see that we compare the digest to see if the message is changed or not.For example, Alice is sending a message to Bob.Let's say, Alice encrypted the message with her own private key. Bob decrypted it with Alice's public key. This ensures the Authenticity. However, from my perspective, doesn't this also ensure the integrity? Since we can know this message is sent by Alice, which means this is not sent by other people, doesn't this ensure the integrity at the same time?

    "28": "What does best-effort mean? When I read the textbook, the author says *It might appear that best-effort service is a euphemism for no service at all—a network that delivered no packets to the destination would satisfy the definition of best-effort delivery service!* (from textbook page 310). It seems quite counterintuitive to me. I think IP and UDP provide no effort at all...Anyway, can we say IP, TCP, and UDP are all best-effort services because all of them meet the least requirement of such a definition? It means there is no guarantee of transmission. Best effort means it will try to send the packet/frames but it does not guarantee successful transmission. Best effort service means that IP does NOT guarantee the \"delivery\" (NOT the transmission as stated in the above comment. You can transmit at any time you wish!) of packets (in-order, error free).UDP does NOT guarantee the application that all datagrams are delivered in-order and error free to application. Hence it is Best effortTCP on the other hand does guarantee the delivery of Bytes (in-order and error-free) to the application and hence it is beyond Best effort service!!!
