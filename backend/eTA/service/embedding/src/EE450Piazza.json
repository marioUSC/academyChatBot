The questions regarding the integrity, authentication, and Confidentiality.1. A sender sends a message encrypted with the public key of recipient. Which is not provided?In my opinion, confidentiality is provided. Therefore, authentication and integrity are not provided. But we are only allowed to select one answer. Therefore, I am confused.2. A sender sends a message encrypted by his own private key. Which is not provided?In my opinion, authentication is provided. Therefore, confidentiality and integrity are not provided. But still, we are only allowed to choose one.Thanks. Answer:  You are missing the most important word in question which is \"NOT\". Can you explain why do you say \"Data Integrity is NOT provided\"??? How could Trudy alter the message if the message is encrypted!!Only authentication (any one could use the recipient public key) is NOT provided.You are making the same mistake in the second question as well. If you encrypt your message with your private key, anyone can decrypt it using your public key and hence confidentiality is NOT provided. Both authentication (once you can decrypt the message using the public key of sender, that means the sender is who he claims to be) and data integrity (Trudy can not alter the message as it is encrypted)  are provided.",

I am repeating it hereIf A is sending a frame to B and C is sending a frame to D, the frame from A will be collided with (collision happens at node B) but the frame from C to D will not be affected.

    "28": "Question: What does best-effort mean? When I read the textbook, the author says *It might appear that best-effort service is a euphemism for no service at all—a network that delivered no packets to the destination would satisfy the definition of best-effort delivery service!* (from textbook page 310). It seems quite counterintuitive to me. I think IP and UDP provide no effort at all...Anyway, can we say IP, TCP, and UDP are all best-effort services because all of them meet the least requirement of such a definition? Answer:  It means there is no guarantee of transmission. Best effort means it will try to send the packet/frames but it does not guarantee successful transmission. Best effort service means that IP does NOT guarantee the \"delivery\" (NOT the transmission as stated in the above comment. You can transmit at any time you wish!) of packets (in-order, error free).UDP does NOT guarantee the application that all datagrams are delivered in-order and error free to application. Hence it is Best effortTCP on the other hand does guarantee the delivery of Bytes (in-order and error-free) to the application and hence it is beyond Best effort service!!!

Shouldn't it compare its modified table to its old table as shown in the diagram on slide 17?

    "58": "Question: HW4 P15 Non-Unique Forwarding Tables Since R1 can reach E through either of the bottom 2 interfaces, does it matter which one we assign in the forwarding table? My understanding is that these tables can be generated differently depending on criteria, so it seems like there could be multiple possible forwarding tables right? Answer:  Theoretically, you are right but the author is assuming that NO packet is actually destined to any of the routers interfaces which means the following:If R1 receives a packet (we don't care from where) then the destination IP address must be a host on subnets A or B or C, i.e. the packet can't be destined to say R2 interfaces or R3 interfaces. The forwarding Table at R1 should have 3 entries as follows:If destination host is in subnet A, then the outgoing interface should be the one connected to subnet AIf the destination is in subnet B then the outgoing interface should be the one connected to subnet DIf the destination is a host in subnet C, then the outgoing interface should be the one connected to subnet Fand similarly for R2 and R3.The author is assuming all point-to-point links are of the same length and hence he is using the shortest distance criteria (or minimum number of hops)The author is sloppy for neglecting these assumptions in his question.

    "62": "Question: Chapter 4 Problem 15 When calculating the necessary length of each of the subnets are including the 2 addresses needed for the network address and broadcast? Basically do we need to add 2 to the number of addresses supported by that subnet? Also when I attempted this problem I ran out of IP addresses because I needed to round the amount of interfaces supported to the next power of 2 because 250 and 120 are not powers of 2. Is there another address block I can use, if not how do I give the subnets that did not receive blocks the necessary number of addresses. Answer:  The professor had sent out an email regarding this problem. He said that in this scenario we can \"borrow\" the addresses that are not used from the networks. (6 from the 250 are not used, 8 from the 120 are not used). But this won't be the case in the final exam. Start with a Block of 214.97.254.0/23. Divide it into two sub-blocks of size /24 each, i.e. steal one bit from host214.97.254.0/24 and 214.97.255.0/24. The author decided to assign the second block to subnet A.Now take the block 214.97.254.0/24 and divide it into two sub-blocks of /25 each (ie. steal another bit from the host), we get;214.97.254.0/25 and 214.97.254.128/25The author decided to assign the second block to subnet CThe remaining block which is 214.97.254.0/25 is divided as follows:214.97.254.0 and 214.97.254.1 were assigned to subnet D interfaces (equivalent to a block of 214.97.254.0/31)214.97.254.2 and 214.97.254.3 were assigned to interfaces of subnet E (equivalent to block 214.97.254.2/31)214.97.254.4 through 214.97.254.7 were assigned to interfaces of subnet F (equivalent to 214.97.254.4/30)The remaining 120 addresses in the block 214.97.254.0/25 were assigned to subnet B which means subnet B got a block represented by214.97.254.0/25 - 214.97.254.0/29All of the above are assumptions from the Author.

However in this case, since we terminate the programs manually using Ctrl+C from the terminal(s), these sockets wouldn't close? Is this assumption correct? Would the only way to close the sockets in this case be to close them in the SIGINT handler or something?I read online that the OS will eventually disconnect these sockets, but I find it annoying for these sockets to remain in use and I have to wait a bit in between subsequent runs. Is there a simple way to reduce this time before the sockets are cleared or something of the sort? I feel like I have to wait upwards of 30-60 seconds in between runs of the program.Thanks and Happy Thanksgiving! Answer:  I also have the same problem. I think the abnormal shutdown of the program cannot release the port resources.

Yuncong Cui 6204295381:I think you can use two ways to solve this.1. Use string instead of char array. This is most convient way to solve this. You do not have to worry about the pointer.2. Use formal argument (parameter). Send \"ans\" this array to the \"whatever\" function as a formal argument. Then you can directly change the \"ans\" in the function. The \"ans\" in your main function will be changed at the same time.I think the problem of your code is1. Your return type is char. You want send a char array back. This is not gonna work. You need to use char * as your return type at least. 2. Return * ret means the value of address ret. If you do not add a location about this array, * ret is *ret[0] as default, which is the value of the first character in your char array. That's the situation you have in your first picture. What you might want to do is to send the address of this array back, you can not return the value of a char array.char * whatever (...) { char * ret = ... ;  ....  return ret;}3. When you receive the return value, you also cannot receive a char array. You can only can the return value of a char variable of the address of a char array.char * ans; ans = whatever(...);4. When you output a char array by %s, make sure your char array is ended by a '\\0'.Just give you these suggestions in case you still want to use pointer and char array, but I recommend \"string\" if you want to solve it faster.  I think the instructor is right, you might want to work more on the pointer, and also the return value of a function, and also char array.",

Answer:  Well, you don’t need the dynamic port for serverM. SeverM accept the connection request from client via its TCP port and communicate with other servers via UDP. In my opinion, serverM doesn’t have to know the dynamic port used by client. But I’m not sure if it’s correct. Please wait for other’s confirmation.  As the other student said You don't need the dynamic port used by client at serverM, but if you need it for verification/debugging, you can obtain it from the sockaddr structure which you are using in the accept() call at serverM.

I'm not using the ClientPort number in any of my send/recv TCP commands.I'm not sure how I even would, isn't the connection initiated by the client to the port of the serverM? What's the purpose of knowing the ClientPort number? Answer:  In the examples given in the Beej's guide, the client port number is dynamically allocated. You don't have to implement anything extra. For printing the messages on the console at the clinic side, you might need the port number which is getting dynamically allocated (refer @188). When a TCP child socket is created, the address parameter at the server side holds the info about client's dynamic port and IP, and you might have noticed that you would use the same child socket descriptor to respond back to the client and since the client's info is already stored (the recv function internally handles it), you need not \"manually\" keep track and explicitly specific  the client's port while sending a response back.",

Answer:  Since the order of execution is sequential (and one client at a time - no multi-threading), you don't need to use select and poll functions.

Therefore, the port number will change. However, as long as it is a dynamic port, we should be fine, correct? I am asking because I saw that we need to keep the port same in previous posts. But in post @367, I was informed that as long as it is dynamic then it will be fine.Regarding the second question in @367, if we are required to keep the client dyanmic port the same, when I close the client and open it again without restarting the main server, my server will not respond to the new open client anymore.

Because we should make sure the client UDP socket is compatible with the UDP socket of the server that we want to send message to. However, in Project scenario, all three backend server have the same configuration, so we can use the same UDP socket in serverM to send message. Which way is expected in grading? Answer:  For UDP the same socket is used for all three backend server instances and it shouldn't be closed, only TCP creates a child socket for each application. UDP will receive all packets at the same port no matter the application. Use the same UDP socket for the communication every time. Well it's true that the serverM will be acting as a client when it sends requests to other backend servers, but in real world scenarios, we never open dynamic ports on the fly at the server side. Usually servers receive tens of thousands of requests per second, and if we decide to open a new socket for each request, we'll be out of port numbers very soon (which are limited). So, we go for a static port on the server side.Update: If you want to close and create the socket again with the same port number, you can do that (or) you can use the same UDP socket initially created. Make sure that the port# of UDP socket is the static port given in the problem description.",

I understand that the server closes the child socket after sending \"Hello world!\" each time.

This works fine until my client code decides to Ctrl+C, then the while loop on the server side runs infinitely printing out whatever I have inside the !fork() statement. Is there a way to control this behavior to close the child socket and listen to a new TCP connection? Answer:  In Beej's tutorial, there is usually a step that includes checking the return value every time the server uses the TCP child socket that is connected to the client. So essentially every time send or receive is called from the server side. If you work on the assumption that the network and OS will no give you errors, then if a client closes the connection, you end up receiving a negative return value from the send or receive calls and can decide how to proceed then.

You can also code using remote development with VS Code: the app on your Mac can be the client, and you can set it up to SSH into your VM so that the actual location of the code (and terminal windows you open in VS Code) is on your VM. This way you can have the environment of the VM with the experience of coding on your Mac, this is what I'm doing.",

Answer:  You would list the data types you used for each type of transaction like an authentication request would have its on description and explain what parts of the the message sent corresponds to header and data. Kind of like when the project instructions says:\"For example: Send 0 to serverM to indicate that the authentication request has failed (no username), send 1 to serverM to indicate that the authentication request has failed (password does not match) and 2 to serverM to indicate that the authentication request has passed. Or PASS indicates that the authentication request has passed, FAIL_NO_USER indicates that the authentication request has failed (no username), and FAIL_PASS_NO_MATCH indicates that the authentication request has failed (password does not match).\"Explain the message format meaning you chose to use and what each part of the message.

But sometimes my main server receives the error of course not found from the department backend server, in this case I am technically sending something to the client to indicate this error, but should I still print this message? Also, sometimes my main server does not even contact a department server because it detects that the course code does not begin in CS or EE so must be invalid - should I print this message in these cases too?Thanks! Answer:  As the project document did not specify otherwise, it is my understanding that in either of these cases you should still send that message regardless of if what you were looking for was not found or if it was found.  If a specific scenario is not mentioned in the project description, you can implement it however you feel is appropriate.

I tried setting up a for loop in the client side but it takes in junk values at the second attempt. I also tried setting up for loops in the server (serverM) side, but it also doesn't seem right. Wonder what kind of values need to cleared after each loop? Answer:  Loop is not the key affecting your program success or failure. You can even use GOTO ( if allowed, it’s one of my favorite statements while learned from BASIC programming language, introduced at 1964) to achieve your goals once put them in the correct position. Regarding your garbage value during second attempt, it’s probably caused by stdin/stdout. Try fflush(stdout/stdin); before ffget any input from terminal. Hint: control each input/transmitingstring size precisely and allocating corresponding buffer wisely are the keys to succeed in this project personally. Also remember all valid string in c should terminated with ‘\\n’.

    "173": "Question: question about udp between serverM and serverC 1. Does serverM need to bind the udp socket with its own address? So serverM should call getadreessinfo twice, right?2. After serverM send username and password to serverC, does serverM simply call recvfrom afterwards and hope serverC sends the result back? I feel there is some kind of racing here. Thank you Answer:  1.) Since we already know the HARDCODED UDP port number, there's no need to call getadreessinfo.2.) If you call recvfrom after sending the data from serverM, the code execution will be blocked at serverM unless it receives any data from serverC. Also you might have noticed the same in serverC that recvfrom blocks the code execution unless it receives any data from serverM.If you are coming from web development background, another way to visualize this is to think that recvfrom is NOT an async function, which means it will wait till it receives any data.",

The only conclusion I've been able to make is that it seems to work when I have only the authentication loop. Specifically when I introduce the if/else statement for the multi-course querying in the second loop it seems to cause issues in that first recvfrom(), but I am very confused since these two sections shouldn't affect each other.  I have not split my code into functions and am simply calling all the UDP steps every  time when I need to sendto() and recvfrom(). This would mean that some code/variables might be repeated e.g. memset(&var, 0, sizeof(var)) or int udp_socket_descriptor; or buffer_udp[#]; in multiple places. Could this be an issue, or do you have any ideas of what else it might be? I'm very confused why it is working for some code. Answer:  If you're able to send the authentication request (since you have explicitly mentioned that the issue is with receiving the result) you shouldn't be facing any issues.If your program in serverM is blocked at recvfrom then it could be a connection issueYou can try debugging by using the getsockname() api at serverM, print out the port linked to the udp socket before you call recvfrom(). and print the port which you're sending to on serverC (sending_address.sin_port) and see if they are matching.",

However, In TCP, the servinfo can be freed just after bind(), and will not affect TCP's data transmission. May I ask why this is the case? Which chapter of Beej's book should I revisit for this problem? Answer:  I am assuming you are using freeaddrinfo() for freeing the structurefreeaddrinfo is just a wrapper call which calls the free() function on all the elements in the linked list containing the addresses(the first element is pointed to by servinfo in Beej's code). So if you call sendto or recvfrom using the addresses from the linked list after you have called freeaddrinfo (For example in Beej's Guide :sendto(sockfd, argv[2], strlen(argv[2]),0,p->ai_addr, p->ai_addrlen) <- in this case p is an element of the linked list) would cause issues(you are accessing memory which you have already freed).Solution would be to assign the addrinfo to a local variable if you are still planning to use it.",

Could the connection between the two be FDX since switches can support this or not since hubs do not support FDX? Is there some sort of hierarchy at play that I'm completely missing here?For hubs, we see that the link would get the 1/N average throughput across it (N being the number of nodes) whereas for switches, we see that the link would get the full dedicated link throughput, so I am under the impression that this distinction is important to calculating the network throughput.Even after re-watching the discussion and the relevant lecture and textbook section, I am still confused about how we can determine throughput of this network.In the discussion, the TA showed that the rate in either direction of hub-switch link would be possibly different (ex: R1 = (1/7 x 4)4R and R2 = 4R).In the case that the hub-switch link is HDX I don't understand the role that these R1 and R2 values would play in the throughput calculation for the network as a wholeIf the link truly is FDX, then are the switch to hub links just 1Gbps in each direction and overwhelm the the departmental network? Or, does this link get a throughput of 1/4Gbps and not utilize the whole link despite being a dedicated link? Answer: ",
    "220": "Question: Static UDP Ports Can we use a static UDP ports for sending data from serverM to the backend servers? and visa versa?The project description says the UDP ports for serverM, serverC, serverEE, and serverCS must by static and binded. However, I cannot get the sockets associated with serverM to work for SENDING unless I create a new socket.It's the same situation with the backend severs. I can send a message to serverM directly if I capture the address that it used to send the message to the backend servers, but this would be associated with a dynamic port, not a static one. If I wanted to send a message to serverM's static UDP port, I would need to create a dynamic sending socket for the back end servers.If there is a way to get these ports to work otherwise? Can someone please provide guidance? Answer:  If you need to send a message to serverM's static UDP port, it is not mandatory for the sending socket (at the backend server) to be dynamic. Essentially you have to call the bind function for both the sending and receiving sockets before calling sendto() and recvfrom(). If you do not call bind before calling sendto() or recvfrom() the NOS will assign a random free port to your socket, which makes it dynamic(applicable for UDP sockets). By calling bind() on both your socket before the communication starts you are assigning a specific port to your socket",

    "227": "Question: Why does a switch have MAC address (p22 related) Since a switch is transparent to nodes, the receiver or sender's MAC address of the frame should not be the switch's MAC address. If this is the case, why does a switch has a MAC address in the first place?  Answer:  From the \"MAC Addresses\" section of 6.4.1 in textbook:It's important to note, however, that link-layer switches do not have link-layer addresses associated with their interfaces that connect to hosts and routers. Of course a L2 switch have a MAC address for each of its ports. The statement in the textbook is a bit misleading. What the author wanted to convey is that these MAC addresses are NEVER used as a destination MAC address for any frame a node sent since, as we discussed in class, the switch is transparent to end nodes. Then the question remains why do L2 switches need MAC addresses though? Unfortunately we discuss this in EE555. Switches need to communicate with other switches to prevent loops from occurring using a Protocol called \"Spanning Tree Protocol\". In that Protocol, switches need to identify their MAC addresses to each other. Further more, MAC addresses of switches are needed to enable Network Admin the ability to \"manage\" switches remotely.Stay safe and healthyP.S.

Answer:  If your are asking about the switch, initially it's switch table will be empty. It will self-learn about the MAC addresses and location of the nodes once the nodes start exchanging information amongst themselves. For solving this problem, you don't need the info about the number of MAC addresses stored in the switch table.

    "244": "Question: Server - Server Communication using UDP Hello,Hopefully my understanding of the UDP code and client server process is correct, otherwise none of my questions will make sense below.So from beej's networking guide (link), it seems like part of the process of communication from a client to a server is for the client to ensure it's setting up it's socket so that it has compatible socket address parameters with the server. In the screenshot below, the getaddrinfo function is used by the server to set up a socket based on the parameters specified (i.e ai_family, ai_socktype, and ai_flags). However, on the client side, they populate these parameters so that they match the parameters of the server that they're sending to.So does that then mean that the following needs to be the same on the client and server side:ai_family --> this is IPv4 or IPv6ai_soctype --> it's clear that this will be SOCK_DGRAM from both the client and the server so no questions hereai_protocol --> beej uses a default of 0 for the server and client hereOther Questions:What do we do if, for example, serverM is using IPv4 on Port #23000 (just an example) and serverC is using IPv6? Do I have to use port #23000 to send UDP messages to serverC? Or can I open a separate socket for M so that it becomes a \"client\" and then the program can intentionally pick a socket that is compatible with serverC.OR, should I just make sure that all servers are set up exactly the same and are therefore are all running under the same IP family (beej uses IPv6 so that is what I would default to)? If I set them all up in the same way, then I won't have to make sure the sockets are compatible every time I send a message between the servers - that is my understanding?Basically what I'm trying to ask is how do you ensure communication is compatible between two servers in UDP? It's not an issue with client/servers because the client will always pick a socket that as parameters that matches the server or return an error. But with servers, once you turn them on (i.e set up the socket), they shouldn't suddenly change their parameters. It feels like a deadlock in a way.  Answer:  As what we discussed in the office hours, you can assume the information about the servers are already known, i.g. port number, and create sockets for each pair of backend server and main server.",

So each device will generate R/7 Mbps of traffic to communicate with every other device (8 devices total -> each device needs to communicate to 7 other devices)Here R1 = Total bandwidth used by all devices connected to the switch to communicate with all the devices connected to the Hub.For each device connected to the switch:R/7 Mbps is required to communicate to each device connected to the hub.There are 4 devices connected to the hub. So 4*R/7 = total traffic generated by each device connected to switch which needs to communicate to all the devices connected to the hub.Since there are 4 devices connected to the switch. Total traffic going across the switch-hub bottleneck: = 4*4*R/7 = 16*R/7= R1 R2 = Total bandwidth used by all devices connected to the hub to communicate with all the devices connected to the switch.Hub aggregates all the traffic, since 4 devices are connected to the hub and each of them generates R Mbps of traffic R2 = 4R",

    "299": "Question: Dynamic Port Numbers I am struggling with how to use getsockname(). Within the project instructions it mentions that we should not hardcode TCP/UDP dynamic port numbers, and instead use getsockname() which takes a socket descriptor and a sockaddr struct.I created a sockaddr_in struct following code in Beej, and this struct has a sin_port port number field that is set to htons(3490) (from Beej example). This gives me a port number when I call the sin_port, but it also remains the same fixed value when I pass the sockaddr_in struct into getsockname() and call sin_port. If I don't set this sin_port field, I always get a port number of 0.Can anyone point me in the right direction? I am confused about how this can become dynamic if this sin_port field is required. Answer:  Before trying out getsockname(), make sure that your server script is running and you are able to make a connection to the server from your client. Once that is done, you can use the following code (or the one given in the project document) to get your dynamic port at client side:Updated:struct sockaddr_in clinetAddress;bzero(&clinetAddress, sizeof(clinetAddress));socklen_t len = sizeof(clinetAddress);getsockname(clientPort, (struct sockaddr *) &clinetAddress, &len);clientPort = ntohs(clinetAddress.sin_port);printf(\"Client's dynamic port number : %u\\n\", clientPort);   ",

Answer:  Usually for TCP multiple ports are opened by the client, but the communication will continue only on one port(decided by the segment which receives the acknowledgement from the server first). In your case the client sends SYN segments using ports 54772 and 54773. The server responds only to 54772 and the communication will proceed on 54772 (The server may send ACK for segment with port 54773 at a later time but usually no communication happens). If you right click on either of the segments and go to Follow>TCP stream a new window will open which will show you the communication between the server and the client on that specific port.

    "353": "Question: Go-Back-N ARQ. Why does sender wait until timeout even after receiving duplicate ACKs? Hello,This is concerning problem 3 in today's discussion session.Host A sends F1 and it is lost. In the meanwhile, Host A receives multiple ACK1 messages before Frame_1 times out. By receiving duplicate ACKs, the sender should know that Frame_1 was lost. But it decides to wait until timeout anyways until re-sending. Why is that the case? Answer:  A follow-up to this question.  Should we assume that in Go-Back-N ARQ the receiver will ACK every packet received or should we assume that the reciever will use an accumulative ACK? The actions of the receiver are implementation-based. Some receivers opt for dropping the frame without responding knowing that the sender will time-out anyway. Most implementations however, the receiver respond by sending a duplicate ACK (TCP uses this strategy and after the sender receives 3 duplicate ACKs, he concludes that the segment was lost and retransmit again. That procedure is referred to as \"Fast Retransmission\".) Either responding after receiving a certain number of duplicated acks or dropping the frame directly without ack is specified by a problem/implementation. And either the retransmission happening after time-out or after receiving N ACKs (N is also specified) is also specified by a problem/implementation.Either ack every packet or accumulatively ack is specified by the problem/implementation.In Problem 3 from the discussion session, we assume ACK every frame and receiver sends duplicate ACKs and retransmission happens when time-out or receiving N duplicate ACKs (where N >= 3) happens first.",

Answer:  In this problem, circuit switching sends a 1 KB message across the network before starting to transfer any data. In packet switching, the packet header is only 24B.

I have a question about SR ARQ acks.Professor says that in SR ARQ, when the receiver receives a frame, it can either acknowledge it or not. If the receiver choose not to send the ack message, how can the sender knows that this frame has been received by the receiver and it does not need to send it again? Answer:  If I'm wrong somebody please correct me but I believe in SR ARQ, the receiver will send an ACK for every good packet. If the ACK is lost, there is a timeout period and the frame is resent. Modified:SR-ARQ does NOT use accumulative ACK. GO-BACK_ARQ can use accumulative ACK.please refer to DLC pdf page 30 under \"Week 6\" folder on D2L for a detailed chart of SR ARQ.If the receiver does not send every single ACK back to the sender, then the sender can not know that frame is received.That is why the sender will store every frame that is sent but not acknowledged yet in its buffer, and set a Timeout.However, if the receiver uses accumulative ACK, it guarantees the sender that all the frames prior to ACK are received.For example, if the receiver sends $$F_{7}^{}$$ to the sender using accumulative ACK, it is telling the sender that $$F_{0}^{}$$ to $$F_{6}^{}$$ have been received successfully.

    "382": "Question: Ch6 - Q27 General Doubt In the homework problem Chapter 6, Q.No 27, whenever L (size of packet) is mentioned, does that include the 5-byte header or while calculating packetization delay we should add 5 more bytes to the specified value of L?Like in part b, it is given L=1500, so does 1500 include the 5-byte header or we should add it bringing the total size of the packet to 1505 ? Answer:  Based on the definition of packetization delay from part a, I don't believe the header is included when calculating packetization delay. While calculating the packetization delay, don't consider the header. But do consider the same while calculating the store and forward delay.",
    "383": "Question: Offer and ACK Destination not the Same The destination of the offer and ACK DHCP messages are the IP address that is offered to the client from the server and differ from the lab example, is this an acceptable difference? I followed the commands in the lab instructions but am unable to capture offer and ACK packets with the broadcast IP as the destination. Answer:  The IP offered to you by your DHCP server does not need to be similar to the one shown in example. Regarding the broadcast of DHCP Offer and ACK, it depends on your Network Operating System. If your NOS supports receiving unicast packet before configuration of offered IP, then it will be sent to single IP (Unicast) by DHCP srver. If your NOS don't support unicast before IP is configured then only you will see broadcast DHCP Offer (255.255.255.255) and ACK.",

    "386": "Question: How does a host decide which DHCP Offer to acknowledge ? In a scenario, where a host might receive, multiple DHCP OFFERs from different DHCP servers.How does the host decide which OFFER it will go with, as in which IP address it will raise the request for?Is there some specific algorithm executed by the network operating system to make this decision or simply whichever request was received first by the host will be given preference (first-come-first-server logic)? Answer:  I think professor mentioned in lecture that it is first come first serve basis. That is the first offer will be accepted. If you have browsed through the RFC2131 like I asked you do, you would have seen the following statement\" The client receives one or more DHCPOFFER messages from one or more servers. The client may choose to wait for multiple responses. The client chooses one server from which to request configuration parameters, based on the configuration parameters offered in the DHCPOFFER messages\"The above means that DHCP leaves that selection algorithm as an implementation detail for the DHCP client. It maybe based on FCFS or it may be based on how long is the lease time of the offered IP address. It may also be based on how many other \"options\" are offered to the client, etc...Stay safe and healthy  ",
    "387": "Question: Client ARP Probing on non DHCP assigned IP address As I filters the ARP packet using Wireshark, My PC is probing two IP addresses. One is the IP address that is offered by the DHCP server. Another IP address my PC is probing is 169.254.19.180, which is a link_local address. Why does my computer requrest a link_local address?  Answer:  Addresses that starts with 169.254 (in the range of 169.254.0.1 ~ 169.254.255.254, hence subnet mask is 255.255.0.0)) are referred to as Automatic Private IP address which allow a client to configure himself automatically if he is not able to see a DHCP server (i.e. when no DHCP server reply to DHCP discover message. These addresses aren’t useful, since the only things they can communicate with are local devices with other Auto configured addresses (That is why you see ARP for that address to make sure it is not used anywhere else in the local network), These addresses are NOT routable on the public internet and they will be replaced with real IP addresses  once the client finds a real DHCP server.Stay safe and healthy",

Professor said that by indicating the relay agent IP is 1.1.1.254, the DHCP server know the network address is 1.1.1.X. But can it not also be 1.1.X.X, or others? How can DHCP be so sure that network address part is 1.1.1.X.Thank you very much. Answer:  The subnet mask (255.255.255.0) will be there in the DHCP message but it is not shown in the picture.

    "392": "Question: Why should IP broadcast implies MAC broadcast and vice versa? So in @78, the instructor replied that because some clients can only accept the broadcast IP address before the whole DHCP process is done, the DHCP offer and ack messages have to be broadcasted. I understand that for this reason, we have to use the broadcast IP address as the destination for the DHCP offer and ack. My question is, couldn't we use a unicast MAC destination with a broadcast IP destination? This way other hosts on the network no longer need to process the DHCP packets. They can drop the messages as soon as they see the destination MAC doesn't match.Similarly, in ARP, the requester knows the IP but not the MAC. Can the requester use a broadcast MAC destination with a unicast IP address? This way other hosts on the network no longer need to process the ARP payload. They can drop the messages as soon as they see the destination IP doesn't match. I actually don't remember if it is indeed how ARP works. If not, why not? Answer:  The ARP request does use a Broadcast MAC address (He doesn't know the unicast MAC address of the destination. That is what he is trying to get). ARP Packet does NOT have a payload just a header (You are confusing the ARP packet with the IP Packet). Review the charts on the format of the ARP Packet.What does the unicast MAC address and a broadcast IP address means!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Think about it for a minute.Stay safe and healthy",

    "397": "Question: Why DHCP offer and ack frames are broadcasted? The client sends its MAC address to the server in the DHCP discover frame. Couldn't the server just use the client's MAC address as the destination for the DHCP offer and ack frames? Answer:  The student's response is right. Updated response:From DHCP RFC(RFC2131):Reason for broadcast for DHCPACK and DHCPOFFER:If 'giaddr' is zero and 'ciaddr' is zero, and the broadcast bit is set, then the server broadcasts DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK messages to 0xffffffff.If the broadcast bit is not set and 'giaddr' is zero and 'ciaddr' is zero, then the server unicasts DHCPOFFER and DHCPACK messages to the client's hardware address and 'yiaddr' address. (Page 22)Unfortunately, some client implementations are unable to receive such unicast IP datagrams until the implementation has been configured with a valid IP address (leading to a deadlock in which the client's IP address cannot be delivered until the client has been configured with an IP address). (Page 24)Here:giaddr:Relay agent IP address, used in booting via a relay agent.ciaddr:Client IP address; only filled in if client is in BOUND, RENEW or REBINDING state and can respond to ARP requestsyiaddr: 'your' (client) IP address.Reason for broadcast for DHCPREQUEST:The client broadcasts a DHCPREQUEST message that MUST include the 'server identifier' option to indicate which server it has selected, and that MAY include other options specifying desired configuration values... The servers receive the DHCPREQUEST broadcast from the client. Those servers not selected by the DHCPREQUEST message use the message as notification that the client has declined that server's offer. (Page 15)So from DHCPREQUEST other servers get to know if the client has selected their IP address According to what Professor explained, the reason of Ack is being broadcasted is not because it has to tell other DHCP servers that a specific IP address is already assigned to the client. (Instead, this is the reason why Request is broadcasted).The reason why Ack is being broadcasted is because some network operating systems do not allow the client to be identified by the offered address until the client gets the acknowledgement.Please let me know if I misunderstand something.

I am trying to move into the discussion section on Friday from 1pm-1:50pm because the Wednesday discussion conflicts with my lab that day for a different class. If you can switch, I would really appreciate it! My email is fhill@usc.edu.  Answer:  I think all students are able to access the recording of 1pm-1:50pm session on DEN.

Thanks Answer:  In P12, \"Suppose all packets are 1500 bytes and rate link is 2.5Mbps\". For follow up session, I think the unit of packet length may be \"bits\". I wish it may be helpful to you.  Just write your assumption down then the grader will grade your answer based on that.",
    "442": "Question: HW1 P21 Hi everyone,I am quite confused that the expressions in P21: \"maximum throughput that server can achieve\". Does it mean that we only need to focus on the link between sever and first router $$R_{1}^{k}$$ (kth path)or we have to consider the whole path's transmission rate(links of each path from server to client)? Answer:  Since throughput is defined as the rate at which you can transmit a given number of bits reliably (from server to client in this case)over a certain period of time(unit = bps). you need to  consider the transmission rates of all the links in the path.",
    "443": "Question: Throughput To calculate throughput, do we need to include T_ack?Today in class, throughput was defined as: rate at which data is delivered (to receiver) reliably measured in bps.I believe we said T_ack must used to determine this but that often it can be neglected.In the book in section 1.4.4 it defines instantaneous throughput and average throughput without mention of T_ack Answer:  TACK is negligible unless the question specify the length of the ACK packet (I will NOT)Stay safe and healthy",

    "451": "Question: PONs and AONs In chapter 1.2.1, it says that \"In the PON architecture, all packets sent from OLT to the splitter are replicated at the splitter.\" Does this means that PON is a shared network system like the cable Internet access?If it is so, then is AON a Switched Netwrok, and the OLT is acting as a switch for the different ONTs?  Answer:  Great question.For PON, as you can see in the figure, each client has their own link and all the packages are sent to every links. So it is a shared network. For the AON, yes, it has a function similar to switch, I'd call it a router. Please refer to this website for further information:https://community.fs.com/blog/pon-vs-aon-in-ftth-systems.html  ",
