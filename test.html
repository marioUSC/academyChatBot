    <title>Gateway Return Inquiry</title>

<body>
    <p>Hi, I'm wondering if this is the correct place to return the gateway?</p>
    <p><img src="/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&prefix=paste%2Fky7yf4kejiayz%2F5915de890feef2d0c5e63d0df8a9bf94288bb0afd4be04a52321c2014dec95e0%2F2302af54634af427a94e47a9f260ece.jpg" alt="2302af54634af427a94e47a9f260ece.jpg" height="480" /><br />
    Or if I want to return the gateway to the University, where do I go to?<br />
    Much appreciated!</p>
    <p>The building should be PHE, but Professor Goodney seems not in his office this morning. You can try to return to CS front desk at SAL. But for returning at SAL, you may need to contact Professor Goodney first.</p>
